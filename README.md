Week 1:
*pulled data and created data frame 
*renamed score and country columns to be identical for all years
*combined tables
*selected certain columns to be used further

Week 2: ETL:
Cleaned, relabeled columns to make labels the same for all data files (for each year ie 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019). I joined, but at the final, I concatenated the dataframes. Took combined data frames to create one datafile as excel file.


Week 3: Visualization:
Took Week 2 excel datafile that contains all five years of data into Tableau and created interactive visualization of findings.
Created visualization with Tableau

Week 4: Machine Learning Rationale (Mildred)

Title: Thought process in the utilization of machine learning in the group project

The three broad categories of machine learning at our disposal are:
1)	Supervised Machine Learning
2)	Unsupervised Machine Learning
3)	Neural Networks & Deep Learning Models
The question that we were trying to predict were how people would answer questions regarding their level of happiness and contributing factors.  Of the three mentioned broad categories of machine learning, supervised machine learning was best.  Prior to embarking on supervised machine learning, we used neural networks which failed to result in any semblance of pattern, much less, prediction.  Neural network failed to extract features and patterns on its own without labeled outcomes.  ‘Happiness’ is such an abstract word, which invokes different meaning from different people.  I suppose we were challenging the ‘abstractness’ of the word and hope to pry some pattern and even better, predictions from its abstractness.   
The reality is that a massive world study was done and resulted in the publication of the World Happiness Report.   This report found 6 factors that contribute to people’s happiness ranking:
1.GDP per capita: based on Purchasing power parity (PPP)
2.Social Support: having someone to count on in times of trouble
3.Healthy life expectancy: from WHO data repository
4.Freedom to make life choices: satisfaction level
5.Generosity: donation
6.Perceptions of corruption: government corruption and business corruption
We used supervised machine learning, specifically linear regression to illustrate the outcome of the World Happiness Report and to build prediction models.  Because of results from the report, data was classified and so linear regression can sufficiently predict patterns based on continuous variables.  Furthermore, the study made data available and revealed for features and target variables.
