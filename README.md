Segment 4:
- Worked on my slides
- Presentation note: We joined 2015-2019 tables in pgAdmin, and limited to the top 10 countries for easy comparison. Then, we colored the top 5 countries to have a better view of the changes in Ranking. What’s worth mentioning is that Finland was top 6 back in 2015, but it jumped to Top 1 in 2018 and maintained its place in 2019. On another hand, Switzerland dropped from top 1 to top 6 throughout the years.

# World Happiness Report Analysis

## Happiness Summary

![](https://github.com/vyu821/world-happiness-analysis/blob/emma-1/Happy%20image.jpeg)

* **Topic: World Happiness Report Analysis**

* **Reason selecting the topic:**

  We wanted to ask you a question - what do you want the most in life? We bet most of your answer is "To be Happy".
  If happiness is the most important in life, then it worth the effort to be measured. We want to understand what makes a great life and share the information with people around us and inform the leaders as to the activities that they need to do in order to improve people’s lives. It’s a lesson for leaders to look around and see in which countries people do regard themselves as very happy and then ask why and apply it in their countries. 



* **Data source: Gallup World Poll.**

  Gallup World Poll provides the report on a uniform comparable basis right across the world to measure how people value their own lives and that’s the single most important statistic in the world. Since 2012, Gallup’s World Poll has been a primary source of global data behind the life satisfaction rankings released in SDSN (Sustainable Development Solutions Network)'s highly publicized World Happiness Report. So far, SDSN has published eight reports. Our analysis contains report data from 2015 to 2019.  
  
* **Questions we hope to answer with data: how the 6 factors have been chosen is impacting people's happiess.**  

  Analysis focused on 6 main factors based on the poll results from 156 countries:

  1.GDP per capita: based on Purchasing power parity (PPP) 

  2.Social Support: having someone to count on in times of trouble

  3.Healthy life expectancy: from WHO data repository

  4.Freedom to make life choices: satisfaction level
  
  5.Generosity: donation

  6.Perceptions of corruption: government corruption and business corruption

Title: The Thought Process In The Utilization Of Machine Learning In The Group project

The three broad categories of machine learning at our disposal are:

1)	Supervised Machine Learning
2)	Unsupervised Machine Learning
3)	Neural Networks & Deep Learning Models

The question that we were trying to predict were how people would answer questions regarding their level of happiness and contributing factors.  Of the three mentioned broad categories of machine learning, supervised machine learning was best.  Prior to embarking on supervised machine learning, we used neural networks which failed to result in any semblance of pattern, much less, prediction.  Neural network failed to extract features and patterns on its own without labeled outcomes.  ‘Happiness’ is such an abstract word, which invokes different meaning from different people.  I suppose we were challenging the ‘abstractness’ of the word and hope to pry some pattern and even better, predictions from its abstractness.   

The reality is that a massive world study was done and resulted in the publication of the World Happiness Report.   This report found 6 factors that contribute to people’s happiness ranking:

1.GDP per capita: based on Purchasing power parity (PPP)
2.Social Support: having someone to count on in times of trouble
3.Healthy life expectancy: from WHO data repository
4.Freedom to make life choices: satisfaction level
5.Generosity: donation
6.Perceptions of corruption: government corruption and business corruption

We used supervised machine learning, specifically linear regression to illustrate the outcome of the World Happiness Report and to build prediction models.  Because of results from the report, data was classified and so linear regression can sufficiently predict patterns based on continuous variables.  Furthermore, the study made data available and revealed for features and target variables.
