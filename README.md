## Segment 1, database
- I created an ERD of the database [schema.sql](schema.sql)
- We will import our data into pgAdmin4 using Pandas and SQLAlchemy, the functions being create_engine and to_sql().
- The columns of the tables were determined by looking at each table and selecting the common headers.
