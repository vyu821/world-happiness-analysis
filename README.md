# World Happiness Report Analysis

## Duties of Elisa Sanchez in Segment 3
Elisa Sanchez performed the following sections of happiness_machine_learning_model.ipynb:

1. Data preprocessing: Added year column and merged all dataframes 

2. Check linearity: In segment 2, we checked linearity for each individual year. In segment 3, we are looking at the aggregate of all five years since the years won't change the regression model predictions. It simply didn't make sense to check for linearity for all five years separately. 

3. Build Linear Regression Models: Added code to enter a score from each of the four factors and get the happiness score. Additionally, evaluated the models performances with mean absolute error. 

4. Build Multiple Linear Regression Model: Decided to build a multiple linear regression model to be able to change scores of the four factors at the same time and see what the happiness score would be. Additionally, evaluated the models performances with mean absolute error.
