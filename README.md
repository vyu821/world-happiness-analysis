* **Topic: World Happiness Report Analysis**

* **Reason selecting the topic:**

  We wanted to ask you a question - what do you want the most in life? We bet most of your answer is "To be Happy".
  If happiness is the most important in life, then it worth the effort to be measured. We want to understand what makes a great life and share the information with people around us and inform the leaders as to the activities that they need to do in order to improve people’s lives. It’s a lesson for leaders to look around and see in which countries people do regard themselves as very happy and then ask why and apply it in their countries. 



* **Data source: Gallup World Poll.**

  Gallup World Poll provides the report on a uniform comparable basis right across the world to measure how people value their own lives and that’s the single most important statistic in the world. Since 2012, Gallup’s World Poll has been a primary source of global data behind the life satisfaction rankings released in SDSN (Sustainable Development Solutions Network)'s highly publicized World Happiness Report. So far, SDSN has published eight reports. Our analysis contains report data from 2015 to 2019.  


* **Questions we hope to answer with data: how the 6 factors have been chosen is impacting people's happiess.**
